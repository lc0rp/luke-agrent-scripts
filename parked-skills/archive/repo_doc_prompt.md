If you were to only use the existing proteus docs as a reference, but were to discard the IA methodology that they are based on, and to only use docs/onafriq_documentation_playbook_one_pager.md as the primary source of methodology,
  describe how you would approach the process of documenting the proteus project for 3 primary audiences: builders (product & engineering), operators (content creators & maintainers) and users (end users). Document your approach in detail
  such that another agent or documentor who didn't have access to docs/onafriq_documentation_playbook_one_pager.md or who was reviewing another project (not proteus) could use the same approach. Use full sentences, and bias towards ESL
  grammar and vocabulary. Document your approach in docs/repo_doc_skill.md and put any reference material you would bundle with the approach in docs/repo_doc_references/. Finally, create docs/proteus/ and within it recreate in full detail,
  from the ground up, the documentation for the proteus project, for the 3 primary audiences mentioned (builders, operators and users), based on your described methodology.


Great work with creating the repo_doc_skill.md and repo_doc_references/! 
Let's make the following change: add a 4th audience: Testers (QA engineers and test automation engineers).
Please update your approach, detailed in docs/repo_doc_skill.md to include Testers as a primary audience, so that the audiences are now: Builders (product & engineering), Operators (content creators & maintainers), Testers (QA engineers and test automation engineers), and Users (end users). Create or update any reference material in docs/repo_doc_references/ as needed to support this change. 

Please take note of the following changes:
- The new proteus documentation (new docs) you created has been moved to the proteus project, and resides at /data/projects/onafriq-proteus/docs.
- The original proteus documentation (old docs) has been moved to in /data/projects/onafriq-proteus/docs/builders/reference/v1-dev-docs-archive/

Please now update the new docs to add comprehensive content for the Testers audience, based on the updated methodology, the old docs, and the project itself at /data/projects/onafriq-proteus/.
